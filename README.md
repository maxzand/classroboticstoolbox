# Robotic Arm Dynamics and Force Control Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to the Robotic Arm Dynamics and Force Control Simulator! This MATLAB App, built using App Designer, aims to provide a user-friendly graphical interface to simulate the dynamics and force control of a robotic arm. By inputting Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, masses, gear ratios, and other relevant parameters, users can visualize and analyze the behavior of the robotic arm under various conditions.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions are made in all calculations performed by this simulator:
1. All joints are either revolute or prismatic.
2. All links are straight.

## Features

- **Input Parameters:** Easily input DH parameters, masses, gear ratios, and other necessary parameters through an intuitive interface.
- **Simulation:** Simulate the dynamics of the robotic arm and observe the force control in real-time.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the robotic arm's motion and forces acting on each joint and link.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and easy-to-navigate interface designed for both beginners and experts in robotics.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxzand/classroboticstoolbox.git
